You roll the dice you move up a few or one points, but you don't look behind nor do you go back."

We can approximate the curve to have small regtangles as your final position minus your inital positio divided by the number of retangles you wish to have, this is for the width of one rectangle. this is only for one. but you dont want one retangle you want all of them that correspond to the curve. for this you need to keep on adding every rectangle within the curve. the way you want to do this is to a loop, what is loop, its almost like taking a step do some stuff then take another step and repeat. with this loop for n loops it has to be within the range of the number of retangles. what you do inside is calculate the area, initally lets just say we start off a zero we move up by 1 retangle, that is the (inital postion plus the width of rectangle multiplied by what setp you are one) times the width of the first retangle plus the area, then you add plus another setp then initiate the next step."
